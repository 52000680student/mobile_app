Task:
1. Can you beautify the select all sample part, as the picture provided it is very rough and ugly
2. In the manual_service_page section, there are still 2 buttons missing: refresh and save. The refresh button, when clicked, will clear all data entered or selected in all forms. And save will make an API call to send data (but the API call has not been implemented yet).
